# ðŸ§  Reinforcement Learning Game Bot (DQN GridWorld)

This project implements a **Deep Q-Learning (DQN) Agent** trained to navigate a custom **2D GridWorld** environment. The agent learns optimal movement strategies using **PyTorch**, **OpenAI Gym**, and **Pygame**.

## ðŸŽ® Features

- âœ… **Custom Grid Environment** using OpenAI Gym API
- âœ… **DQN Agent** with experience replay, target network
- âœ… **Adjustable Difficulty** (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`)
- âœ… **Obstacle Support** for navigation challenge
- âœ… **Live GUI Rendering** with Pygame
- âœ… **Reward Tracking Visualization** with Matplotlib

## ðŸ§  DQN Agent

- Learns to reach the goal while avoiding obstacles
- Reward:
  - Step penalty: -1 to -3 based on difficulty
  - Goal reward: +10 to +30
- Uses epsilon-greedy policy and updates target Q-network periodically

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Reward Visualization

After training, use:
```bash
python visuals/plot_rewards.py
